# Datacamp-Investigating-Netflix-Movies-Duration

**Objective:**
The project aims to apply foundational Python skills, including data manipulation and visualization, to analyze a real-world Netflix movie dataset. 

**Guided Project Tasks:**

1. **Loading your friend's data into a dictionary:**
   - Start by loading data into a dictionary, possibly your friend's viewing history.

2. **Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary:**
   - Convert the dictionary into a pandas DataFrame.

3. **A visual inspection of our data:**
   - Perform a visual inspection of the data to understand its structure and contents.

4. **Loading the rest of the data from a CSV:**
   - Load additional data from a CSV file to expand the dataset.

5. **Filtering for movies:**
   - Filter the dataset to include only movies.

6. **Creating a scatter plot:**
   - Create a scatter plot to explore the relationship between different variables.

7. **Digging deeper:**
   - Conduct deeper analysis and exploration of the dataset.

8. **Marking non-feature films:**
   - Identify and mark non-feature films in the dataset.

9. **Plotting with color:**
   - Enhance visualizations by using color to convey additional information.
